# Claude-Code MCP Controller Development Guidelines

## üö® CRITICAL LEARNING: Never Make Assumptions About New Technologies

### Major Error Correction
**Initial Assumption**: FastMCP package doesn't exist on PyPI
**Reality**: FastMCP 2.12.4 is fully available and production-ready

**What went wrong:**
- Made assumptions without proper verification
- Used wrong pip environment initially
- Created mock implementations instead of using real FastMCP
- Misguided entire project architecture based on false assumptions

**Key Learning:** MCP and FastMCP are very new technologies. **ALWAYS**:
1. ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions
2. ‚úÖ Verify package availability with multiple installation methods
3. ‚úÖ Test in proper development environment
4. ‚úÖ Research thoroughly before declaring something "doesn't exist"

## FastMCP Production Status (VERIFIED)

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Available
- **Package**: `fastmcp==2.12.4` on PyPI
- **Installation**: `uv add fastmcp` or `pip install fastmcp`
- **CLI**: `fastmcp` command available
- **Documentation**: https://gofastmcp.com/

### ‚úÖ Production Ready Features
- Enterprise authentication (Google, GitHub, WorkOS, Azure, Auth0)
- Deployment tools for cloud deployment
- Complete MCP server framework
- Testing utilities and client libraries

### ‚úÖ Real Deployment Options
- FastMCP Cloud (managed hosting)
- Self-hosted with Docker
- Cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Local development with `fastmcp run server.py`

## Development Rules for New Technologies

### üö´ NEVER ASSUME
- Package availability
- Feature capabilities
- Deployment options
- Integration possibilities

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS VERIFY
- Test installations in clean environment
- Read official documentation completely
- Verify with multiple sources
- Ask user for clarification when uncertain

### ‚úÖ ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
Examples of what I should have asked:
- "Have you tested FastMCP installation recently?"
- "What deployment method are you targeting?"
- "Are there specific FastMCP features you want to use?"
- "Should I verify FastMCP availability before proceeding?"

## MCP Technology Stack (VERIFIED)

- **Production Features**: Auth, deployment, testing, monitoring

### ChatGPT Integration
- **Method**: MCP Connectors (Team/Enterprise plans)
- **Custom Connectors**: Can be built with MCP
- **Authentication**: OAuth flows supported
- **Access**: Admins can deploy custom connectors

## Architecture Analysis (Based on Real MCP Documentation)

### Production MCP Architecture Options

After analyzing real MCP specifications and FastMCP capabilities, there are multiple valid production architectures:

#### Option 1: FastMCP Cloud Deployment
```
ChatGPT ‚Üí FastMCP Cloud ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Claude-Code
          (managed hosting via gofastmcp.com)
```

#### Option 2: Self-Hosted with HTTP+SSE Transport
```
ChatGPT ‚Üí Public Endpoint ‚Üí FastMCP HTTP Server ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Claude-Code
          (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE, JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP+SSE)
```

#### Option 3: Enterprise MCP Connector
```
ChatGPT ‚Üí MCP Connector ‚Üí Custom MCP Server ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Claude-Code
          (Team/Enterprise plans with custom connectors)
```

### Key MCP Transport & Security Requirements (Verified from Specs)

**Transport Protocol (MCP 2025-03-26)**:
- JSON-RPC 2.0 over STDIO (preferred) or Streamable HTTP
- HTTP transport MUST validate Origin headers (DNS rebinding protection)
- Supports Server-Sent Events for streaming and server-to-client notifications
- Session management with secure session IDs (UUIDs recommended)

**Authorization (OAuth 2.1)**:
- PKCE required for all clients (public client model)
- Dynamic client registration (RFC7591) recommended
- Authorization Server Metadata discovery (RFC8414)
- Bearer token authentication on all requests
- Third-party authorization flow support (for enterprise integrations)

**Security Requirements**:
- HTTPS mandatory for all authorization endpoints
- Secure session ID generation (cryptographically secure UUIDs)
- Origin header validation for HTTP transport
- Token rotation and expiration enforcement
- Local binding (127.0.0.1 only) for development servers

## Project Status Update

### What Actually Works
1. ‚úÖ **FastMCP Server**: Can be built with real FastMCP
2. ‚úÖ **Cloud Deployment**: FastMCP Cloud available
3. ‚úÖ **ChatGPT Integration**: MCP connectors support custom servers
4. ‚úÖ **Local Supervisor**: Already implemented and working
5. ‚úÖ **End-to-End Flow**: Completely possible with real stack

### Next Steps (Updated with Real MCP Knowledge)

**Production Deployment Decision Required**:
1. **Choose Architecture**: FastMCP Cloud vs Self-Hosted vs Enterprise Connector
2. **Implement OAuth 2.1**: With PKCE, dynamic client registration, metadata discovery
3. **Security Hardening**: Origin validation, secure session management, HTTPS enforcement
4. **Test Integration**: End-to-end ChatGPT ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Claude-Code flow

**For Single-User Use Case** (most likely scenario):
- FastMCP Cloud deployment (simplest)
- No dynamic client registration needed (single known client)
- Bearer token authentication sufficient
- Focus on reliable HTTP+SSE transport implementation

## Communication Protocol

### Response Structure Rule
**ALWAYS start responses with clear action items first, then provide context:**

1. **Action Items** (what to do immediately)
2. **Brief explanation** (why)
3. **Technical details** (if needed)

Example:
```
## Action Required:
1. Run: python3 supervisor/main.py
2. Run: ngrok http 8080
3. Use ngrok URL in ChatGPT

## Why: FastMCP HTTP transport has bugs, supervisor works directly.
```

### When Working with New/Emerging Technologies Like MCP:

### Before Making Technical Decisions
- **Ask**: "Should I verify this technology's current status?"
- **Ask**: "Are there specific deployment requirements?"
- **Ask**: "Have you used this technology recently?"

### When Encountering Issues
- **Don't assume**: "This probably doesn't work"
- **Do investigate**: Test multiple approaches
- **Do ask**: "Can you help me understand why X failed?"

### When Documenting
- **Mark assumptions clearly**: "I believe X but need to verify"
- **Provide evidence**: "Tested with Y environment on Z date"
- **Update when wrong**: Correct documentation immediately

## Key Takeaways

1. **FastMCP is production-ready** - my initial assessment was completely wrong
2. **Always verify before assuming** - especially with new technologies
3. **Ask clarifying questions** - avoid making decisions based on assumptions
4. **Test in proper environment** - environment issues can mislead assessment
5. **Update documentation immediately** - when errors are discovered

This error could have led to:
- ‚ùå Building unnecessary mock implementations
- ‚ùå Missing real deployment opportunities
- ‚ùå Incorrect project architecture
- ‚ùå Wasted development time

**Going forward**: No assumptions about MCP/FastMCP capabilities without explicit verification and user confirmation.
